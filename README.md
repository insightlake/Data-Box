After uploading the files in the staging area vendors/partners can use the Data intake web UI for workflow management.

## Desktop Application
Desktop application is a cross platform application, which allows partners/vendors to upload the content securely. The application can upload large data files (images, videos etc.) in GBs. Vendor/partner can select a folder from his/her computer and upload the content to the staging area. 
Application verifies the content before uploading and flags for errors. For example if quality is bad it will alert the user of the bad quality. Administrators can set up rules for different file types and these rules can integrate with ML classification/prediction models as well.
